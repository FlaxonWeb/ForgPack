# Forg Pack Documentation

**Forg Pack** is a web-based tool designed to simplify the creation of `manifest.json` files and the initial folder structure for **Minecraft Bedrock Edition Addons** (Behavior Packs and Resource Packs). It generates the necessary UUIDs, formats the version arrays, and packages the entire structure into a downloadable `.mcaddon` zip file.

## Features

* **Manifest Creation:** Generates correct `manifest.json` files for both **Behavior Packs (BP)** and **Resource Packs (RP)**.
* **UUID Generation:** Automatically assigns unique UUIDs for all packs and modules.
* **Scripting Support:** Easily include a **script module** with an entry point and add essential **dependencies** like `@minecraft/server`.
* **Cross-Pack Dependencies:** Automatically links the Resource Pack to the Behavior Pack if both are enabled.
* **Custom Folder Names:** Define your own folder names for the BP and RP within the final `.mcaddon` file.
* **Live Preview:** See a real-time JSON preview of your BP and RP manifests.
* **Downloadable Addon:** Generates and downloads a ready-to-use `.mcaddon` zip file with basic file structures.

## How to Use

The main interface is divided into a **Sidebar** for input and settings, and a **Content** area for manifest previews.

### 1. Pack Info (Sidebar)

Fill in the core metadata for your addon.

| Field | Description | Default Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Name** | The display name of your addon. | `My Addon` |
| **Desc** | A short description that appears in the game's pack list. | `Generated by Forg Pack` |
| **Version** | The version of your addon (e.g., `1.0.0`). | `1.0.0` |
| **Min Engine Ver.** | The minimum Minecraft version required (e.g., `1.20.0`). | `1.20.0` |

### 2. Advanced Settings (Sidebar)

| Field | Description | Default Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **BP Folder** | The folder name for your Behavior Pack inside the `.mcaddon` file. | `[PackName]_BP` |
| **RP Folder** | The folder name for your Resource Pack inside the `.mcaddon` file. | `[PackName]_RP` |
| **Script Entry** | The path to your main script file if you enable the script module. | `scripts/main.js` |

### 3. Dependencies (Sidebar)

This section is for adding **module dependencies** to your **Behavior Pack**, primarily for scripting APIs.

1.  Enter the **Module Name** (e.g., `@minecraft/server`).
2.  Enter the **Module Version** (e.g., `1.9.0`).
3.  Click **"Add Dependency"**.

You can **Edit** or **Delete** existing dependencies from the list.

### 4. Control Buttons (Sidebar Bottom)

These buttons enable and configure the pack components.

| Button | Functionality |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Enable BP** | Toggles the creation of a **Behavior Pack** manifest and folder structure. |
| **Enable RP** | Toggles the creation of a **Resource Pack** manifest and folder structure. |
| **Add Script** | Toggles the inclusion of a **script module** inside the Behavior Pack. *Note: You must also add the `@minecraft/server` dependency for your script to work.* |
| **Generate & Download** | Creates an **.mcaddon** zip file containing the generated manifests and basic folders, then prompts for download. |
